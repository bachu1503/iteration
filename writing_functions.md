Writing Functions
================

If you use the same code more than twice, write a function!!! 1. Need to
check inputs in function 2. Start small that does one thing well and
interact easily - avoid unneeded complexity 3. Then add complexity (only
if needed)

### Load packages

``` r
library(tidyverse)
